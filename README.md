# Study_proposal

This github reposetory contains the code corresponding to the sutdy proposal "Using large-scale corpora to quantify similarity‚Äù.
The focus of this proposal is on the question whether word2vec, a word embedding technique, captures the semantic category "animacy". By creating two groups of noun pairs that differ in their animacy statement and calculating their corresponding similarity value it can be analysed wheather word2vec rates nouns that differ in their animacy significantly different compared to nouns that have the same animacy.

The item creation, containing the group creation as well as the similarity measurement, and the resulting items are presented in this repository.
